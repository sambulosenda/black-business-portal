## Review Section

### Phase 1 & 2 Completion Summary

- Successfully verified shadcn/ui was already initialized with components.json
- Added all missing shadcn/ui components:
  - Dialog, Calendar, Alert, AlertDialog
  - Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Progress
  - Avatar, Command, Popover
  - Sonner (replaced deprecated Toast component)
- Verified all application code already uses shadcn/ui wrappers instead of direct Radix UI imports
- Radix UI packages remain in package.json as they are required dependencies for shadcn/ui components

#### Challenges Encountered
- Initial misunderstanding about Radix UI dependencies - they need to remain as shadcn/ui depends on them
