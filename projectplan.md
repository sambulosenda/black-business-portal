- @upstash/ratelimit for API protection
- resend or sendgrid for emails
- uploadthing or AWS S3 for file uploads

### Dependencies to Remove

## Success Metrics
- All Radix UI components successfully migrated to shadcn/ui
- Complete feature parity with modern business portals
- Mobile-responsive design across all pages
- Page load times under 3 seconds
- Accessibility score of 95+ on Lighthouse
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 7-8: 1 week (advanced features & polish)

Total: ~6 weeks for complete implementation

## Review Section

### Phase 1 & 2 Completion Summary

### Changes Made
- Successfully verified shadcn/ui was already initialized with components.json
- Added all missing shadcn/ui components:
  - Dialog, Calendar, Alert, AlertDialog
  - Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Progress
  - Avatar, Command, Popover
  - Sonner (replaced deprecated Toast component)
- Verified all application code already uses shadcn/ui wrappers instead of direct Radix UI imports
- Radix UI packages remain in package.json as they are required dependencies for shadcn/ui components

### Challenges Encountered
- Initial misunderstanding about Radix UI dependencies - they need to remain as shadcn/ui depends on them
- Toast component was deprecated in favor of Sonner

### Future Recommendations
- Phase 3 (Business Dashboard) should be the next priority to enhance business owner experience
- Consider implementing the notification system with Sonner for real-time updates
- The calendar component is now available for the appointment scheduling feature
- Focus on mobile responsiveness when implementing new features
