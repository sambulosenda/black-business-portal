# Search Page UX Improvements - Professional Design Standards

## Overview
Enhance the search page with professional UX standards focusing on spacing, layout, typography, and visual hierarchy using an 8px grid system and established design principles.

## Design System Foundation
- **Grid System**: 8px base unit
- **Spacing Scale**: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px
- **Typography Scale**: Following modular scale (1.25 ratio)
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (640px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1024px), Wide (1280px)
- **Color System**: Maintain existing indigo primary with proper contrast ratios
