# Project Plan: Business Dashboard Design Improvements

## Current Issues
- Dashboard page lacks proper container/wrapper
- Content spans full width without constraints
- Needs more compact and organized layout
- No consistent layout wrapper for business pages

## Todo List
- [x] Add a container wrapper to business dashboard page for better content containment
- [x] Adjust padding and spacing for more compact layout  
- [x] Create a proper business layout wrapper with consistent container
- [x] Review and optimize card spacing and grid layout

## Implementation Approach
1. Add max-width container to constrain content width
2. Reduce excessive padding and spacing
3. Create a business layout component for consistent styling
4. Optimize responsive grid layouts for better space utilization

## Technical Considerations
- Using Tailwind CSS v4 with inline theme configuration
- Maintaining responsive design across devices
- Ensuring accessibility and readability
- Following existing design patterns in the codebase

## Review

### Changes Made:
1. **Added Container Wrapper**: Implemented `container mx-auto max-w-7xl` to constrain content width
2. **Reduced Spacing**: Changed padding from `p-6` to `p-4` and reduced space gaps throughout
3. **Created Business Layout**: Added a new layout.tsx file with consistent navigation and container
4. **Optimized Grid Layout**: Reduced grid gaps and card padding for more compact display

### Summary:
The business dashboard now has proper content containment with a max-width container, more compact spacing throughout, and a consistent layout wrapper with navigation. The layout is now more professional and easier to scan.
